                    <h2>1. How does CalorieScan work?</h2>
                    <p>
                    CalorieScan uses artificial intelligence to analyze food images and estimate
                    calories and nutritional information. Simply take a photo of your meal,
                    and the app will generate an estimated breakdown.
                    </p>

                    <h2>2. Do I need to create an account?</h2>
                    <p>
                    No. CalorieScan does not require login or account creation.
                    You can use the app immediately after downloading.

                    <h2>3. How accurate are the calorie estimates?</h2>
                    <p>
                    Calorie estimates are generated using AI and may not be perfectly accurate.
                    Results depend on image quality, portion size, and food complexity.
                    The information provided is for informational purposes only.
